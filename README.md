# CiscoPacketTracerTry

-Cisco Packet Tracer Projects – Computer Network Systems-
This repository contains several network simulations created using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of the Computer Network Systems course.

-Project Overview-
The uploaded .pkt files demonstrate various networking scenarios, including:
Basic network topologies
IP addressing and subnetting
Routing
VLAN configuration and switching
Routers, switches etc.
Protocol testing (ping, DHCP, DNS, trunking etc.)
Server, transperent, client
Telnet
Ether channel
Port security

-Tools Used-
Cisco Packet Tracer
Windows 11 for running the simulations

-Purpose-
These simulations were created to practice and demonstrate understanding of core networking concepts, configurations, and troubleshooting within simulated environments.
